# Neural-Networks

This Javascript project is aimed at creating a self driving car stimulation using neural links.

in this project I would be implementing simple physics to move the car

I would also be implementing:

*Road Generation - and a birdeye view of the road when the car is moving on it.
*Sensors - using raycasting.
*collisions - using segment intersection formula.
*Neural Networks - an algorithm inspired by the biological neural networks in our Brains.
*Genetic algorithms - 

This project is done with the support of no libraries.
